\begin{abstract}

We present a fully autonomous modular robot system that can perform complex, high-level tasks in an unknown environment without external sensing or control. The validity of the system is demonstrated in a real-world experiment. The physical robot is composed of modules that support multiple robot configurations. An onboard 3D sensor provides information about the environment, which is used to perform SLAM in the unknown environment and inform exploration and feedback control. No external sensors, pose providers, or beacons are used. A centralized planning algorithm uses the information from the environment and the desired high-level task description to synthesize low-level controllers to perform locomotion, reconfiguration, and special actions. A novel, centralized, self-reconfiguration method is used to change robot configurations when desired. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first modular robot system that uses perception-driven reconfiguration to intelligently adapt to an \textit{a priori} unknown environment to perform complex tasks.

\section{Introduction} \label{sec:introduction}
%
Modular self-reconfigurable robot (MSRR) systems are composed of a number of simple repeated robot elements (called \emph{modules}) that connect together to form larger robotic structures. These systems can \emph{self-reconfigure}, changing their shape (\emph{i.e.} the connective structure of the modules) to meet the needs of the task at hand.
In principal, these systems can address a wide variety of tasks by transforming into a wide variety of morphologies.   

Over the past three decades, dozens of modular robot systems have been built \cite{Yim2007a}. Existing literature provides ample evidence of MSRR systems reconfiguring and assuming interesting morphologies, as well as methods for programming, controlling, and simulating modular robots \cite{Yim2007,Jing2016,Yim1994}.

These capabilities are impressive, and each represents a significant research accomplishment in its own right. However, in order to truly live up to their promise of flexible capability in the real world, MSRR systems must demonstrate autonomy: moving, navigating, interacting with objects, and self-reconfiguring, all in unknown environments and without external localization or control. 

We provide a system capable of \emph{autonomously} solving \emph{high-level
tasks} in \emph{unknown environments} using \emph{modular self-reconfigurable
robots}.  A \emph{high-level task} is specified in terms
of general objectives, and requires some decision-making regarding the specific
way in which the task will be solved. The environment is \emph{unknown}, meaning
that the robot does not have a map of the environment or obstacles before the
task begins. To our knowledge, this paper represents the first example of a truly autonomous MSRR system accomplishing these kinds of tasks.

The system we present provides four major tools:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Hardware:} The SMORES-EP Modular robot, and sensing hardware designed
to work with SMORES-EP.  
\item \textbf{High-Level Task Description:} A framework for specifying high-level
tasks in terms of state machines, and for abstracting modular robots.
\item \textbf{Perception and Environment Characterization:} Tools for SLAM,
navigation, and obstacle avoidance with modular robots, as well as tools that
parse sensor information into actionable conclusions relevant to high-level
tasks.
\item \textbf{Reconfiguration:} Software and hardware tools enabling robust
autonomous reconfiguration with SMORES-EP.
\end{enumerate}

Through hardware experiments, we demonstrate that this system is capable of autonomously completing high-level object-retrieval tasks in unknown environments.

\subsection{System Overview}
%
Here we provide a brief overview of the entire system.  Figure~\ref{fig:overview} shows a flowchart which serves as a visual companion to this section. 

Our system is built around the SMORES-EP modular robot. Because the modules cannot sense their environment, we extend the SMORES-EP hardware system by introducing a novel sensor module, described in Section~\ref{sec:hardware}.

Perception-informed exploration is essential to completing tasks in unknown environments.  Section~\ref{sec:exploration} presents a suite of tools that allows the robot to map and explore its environment and identify objects of interest. 

The advantage of modular self-reconfigurable robots lies in their ability to assume different configurations in response to their environment.  In Section~\ref{sec:configuration-specifics}, we describe the library-based framework used to generate appropriate configurations (shapes) and behaviors (controlling programs) for a given task, and in Section~\ref{sec:environment-characterization}, we discuss the methods we use to characterize environments, so that appropriate configurations can be chosen.  In Section~\ref{sec:reconfiguration}, we present a novel centralized reconfiguration method for SMORES-EP.  These three components of the system allow the robot to autonomously assess its environment and reconfigure in order to complete a task.

Finally, Section~\ref{sec:high-level} describes a high-level mission planner that allows tasks to be specified in the form of logical statements which map conditions to actions.  Section~\ref{sec:experiments} demonstrates how the system can be used to complete a realistic object retrieval task in an unknown environment with full autonomy.

\section{Related Work}\label{sec:related-work}
\subsection{Autonomous Self-Reconfiguration}
\label{autonomous-self-reconfiguration}
%
Autonomous reconfiguration has been demonstrated with several modular robot systems. CKbot, Conro, and MTRAN have all demonstrated the ability to join disconnected clusters of modules together \cite{Yim2007, Rubenstein2004,Murata2006}. In order to align, Conro uses infra-red sensors on the docking faces of the modules, while CKBot and MTRAN use a separate sensor module on each cluster.  In all cases, individual clusters locate and servo towards each other until they are close enough to dock.

While these proof-of-concept experiments demonstrate the ability to reconfigure, these capabilities have not been used as part of a larger system to complete tasks. The experiments do not include any planning or sequencing of multiple reconfiguration actions in order to create a goal structure appropriate for a task.  Additionally, because these are all chain-type modular robots, individual modules are not able to locomote on their own, and mobile clusters of modules are limited to slow crawling gaits.  Consequently, reconfiguration is very time consuming, with a single connection requiring 5-15 minutes.

Other work has focused on reconfiguration planning, but not autonomous reconfiguration.  Paulos et al. present a system in which self-reconfigurable modular boats self-assemble into functional floating structures, such as a bridge \cite{Paulos2015}.  Like the SMORES-EP modules used in this paper, individual boat modules are able to move about the pool, allowing for rapid reconfiguration.  However, external localization is provided by an overhead AprilTag system. 

To our knowledge, this paper represents the first examples of a MSRR system autonomously making the decision to reconfigure in response to its sensed environment, and then actually reconfiguring\ in order to complete its task.  In \cite{Dorigo2013}, hand-bot and foot-bot elements of the swarmanoid system connect and disconnect in order to complete a book-retrieval task, but the decision to take this action is not made autonomously by the robot in response to sensed environment conditions.

\subsection{Modular Robots Completing Tasks}
%
%%% Paragraph from intro
% The traditional approach to achieving flexible
% robots is to build  monolithic systems that are highly capable, but also highly
% complex (\emph{e.g.} large humanoids).  Self-reconfigurability is an elegant,
% scalable alternative: since the shape of the robot is not fixed, each individual
% task can be solved with a morphology that is only as complicated as it needs
% to be.
%%%
Modular robots have long been regarded as having the potential to make impact in unknown environments (such as search and rescue scenarios), because  self-reconfiguration theoretically gives them the flexibility to respond to whatever they encounter \cite{Yim2007a,Yim2000}.  However, examples of MSRR actually operating in unknown environments are very limited. To our knowledge, no MSRR system has been used for SLAM. We believe our system has more autonomy in an unknown environment than any existing modular robot system, and represents an important step toward the application of MSRR in the real world.

MSRR systems have demonstrated the ability to accomplish low-level tasks such as various modes of locomotion \cite{Yim1994}. Recently work includes a system which integrate many low-level capabilities of a MSRR system in a design library, and accomplishes high-level user-specified tasks by synthesizing elements of the library into a reactive state-machine \cite{Jing2016}. While this system demonstrates autonomy with respect to task-related decision making, it is designed to operate in a fully known environment with external sensing.

There is work on mapping with swarm robot systems. The Millibot system has demonstrated the ability to map a partially unknown environment when operating as a swarm \cite{Grabowski2000}. The autonomy of the Millibot swarm is limited: a human operator makes all high-level decisions, and is responsible for navigation using a GUI. Certain members of the swarm are designated as ``beacons,'' and have known locations, making the environment only partially unknown.

The swarm-bots are a MSRR system that has been applied in exploration \cite{Dorigo2005} and collective manipulation \cite{Mondada2005} scenarios.  Like the Millibots, exploration is demonstrated in partially unknown environments, with some members of the swarm acting as ``beacons'' with known location.  In a collective manipulation task, the swarm-bots have limited autonomy, with a human operator specifying the location of the manipulation target and the global sequence of manipulation actions. The swarmanoid project (successor to the swarm-bots), moves a step beyond this capability, using a heterogeneous swarm of ground and flying robots (called ``hand-'', ``foot-'', and ``eye-'' bots) to perform exploration and object retrieval tasks in unknown environments \cite{Dorigo2013}.  However, there is no reconfiguration or other transformation of the robots to adapt to unknown features of the environment. Although the location of the object to be retrieved is unknown, the method for retrieving the object is known and constant. We utilize the self-reconfiguration capability of MSRR systems to take autonomy a step further. The system uses perception of the environment to drive not only exploration but also the choice of robot configuration. This allows the robot to adapt its abilities to surmount challenges arising from \textit{a priori} unknown features in the environment.

\subsection{SMORES-EP Modular Robot} \label{sec:smores}
%
Our system is built around the SMORES-EP robot, but could be adapted to
work with other hardware platforms.  In this section, we provide a brief
introduction to the technical capabilities of SMORES-EP.

Each module is the size of an \textit{80mm cube}, and has four actuated degrees of freedom (DoF) - three continuously rotating faces (left, right, and
pan)  and one central hinge (tilt) with a \(180^\circ\) range of motion
(Fig.~\ref{fig:smores-module}). The left, right, and tilt DoF have
 axes of rotation that are parallel and coincident. A single module can use its
left and right wheels to drive around as a two-wheel differential drive robot.
All four faces of the SMORES-EP module have electro-permanent (EP) magnets
that serve as a high-strength, low-energy connector for self-reconfiguration
\cite{tosun2016design}.  Any face of one module can connect to any face of
another.

The magnetic connectors can also attach to objects made of ferromagnetic
materials (such as steel).  By taking advantage of this capability, SMORES-EP
modules can use their magnets to pick up and carry metal objects.
Provided the attachment surface is flat and smooth, the attachment force
between a SMORES-EP face and a strongly ferromagnetic object can be as high as
90N \cite{tosun2016design}.

Each module has an onboard battery, microcontroller, and 802.11b wireless
module to send and receive UDP packets.  In this work, clusters of SMORES
modules were controlled by a central computer running a Python program that
sends wireless commands to control the four DoF and magnets of each module.
Battery life is about one hour (depending on motor, magnet, and radio usage),
and commands to a single module can be received at a rate of about 20hz.
Wireless networking was provided by a standard off-the-shelf  router, with a
range of about 100 feet.

\subsection{Sensor Module} % (fold)
\label{sec:sensor_module}
%

In MSRR systems, sensing and processing capabilities of individual modules are limited by the size and weight constraints of the module form factor. Therefore, the proposed system uses a special sensor module dedicated to sensing and processing equipment, shown in Figure \ref{fig:sensor-module}. The module has no actuation capabilities and is larger than SMORES-EP modules. It is equipped with a front-facing Xtion Pro Live RGB-D sensor which enables the robot to explore and map the environment and recognize objects of interest. A high, downward-facing HD webcam is included to provide a view of the robot itself, which is used for self-reconfiguration. Finally, an UP computing board provides high performance I/O and processing capability in a small form factor. The UP Board used in the proposed system has an Intel Atom 1.92 GHz processor, 4 GB memory, and a 64 GB hard drive. It is network connected via 802.11 wifi. A battery provides power to the Up Board with a lifetime of about 1.5 hours.

\section{Mapping and Exploration}
\label{sec:exploration}
%
Our system provides a robust suite of perception algorithms to inform control and decision-making in unknown environments.  This suite of tools serves three major functions.  First, it enables exploration, allowing the robot to map its environment, localize, and avoid obstacles.  Second, it provides the capability to recognize objects and regions of interest related to the desired task.  Third, it provides functions that characterize environment properties, providing information that allows appropriate configurations and behaviors to be selected from the design library.

%Since the proposed system performs tasks in unknown environments and conditions, a robust suite of perception algorithms is required to inform control and decision-making. The robot must have the ability to explore and build a map of its environment while avoiding obstacles and tracking its pose. The system must be able to recognize objects and regions of interest related to the desired task. Finally, the system must characterize the environment in terms of configuration capabilities. Features in the environment may restrict which robot configurations can viably perform parts of the high-level task, such as retrieving an object or navigating to a waypoint. The system needs to recognize these features to be able to intelligently choose the appropriate robot configuration for performing the task.

Exploration of unknown environments is a core functionality of our system.  While the methods used are not novel in the broader context of robotics,  this system represents (to the authors' knowledge) one of the first modular robot systems capable of exploring and operating in totally unknown environments.

To facilitate the use of open source software and enable networking between components, the proposed system is built in a ROS framework\footnote{http://www.ros.org}. Mapping and robot pose are provided by a RGB-D SLAM software package called RTAB-MAP\cite{rtabmap}. A 3D map of the environment is incrementally built and stored in an efficient octree-based volumetric map using Octomap\cite{octomap}.

The system intelligently explores an unknown environment using using a new next best view planner for object exploration created by two of the authors\footnote{This work has been newly accepted for journal publication in 2017}. This planner directs the robot to explore its environment in a way that maximizes information gain while avoiding collision with obstacles. The algorithm uses the current volumetric map of the environment and estimates the next reachable sensor viewpoint that will observe the largest volume of undiscovered portions of objects. It also estimates the amount of information (in an entropy-reduction sense) that will be gained from a sensor measurement taken at that viewpoint. To integrate into the proposed system, the exploration algorithm is offered as a service that can be queried by the high-level planner when desired. A volumetric map of the environment and the reachable space of sensor viewpoints in that map must be provided to the algorithm. The algorithm then computes and returns the next best view for the sensor, which the high-level planner can then set as a navigation waypoint.

Note that the reachable space is dependent on the locomotion capabilities of the specific robot configuration. This information is associated with the configuration in the design library.

To identify objects of interest to a high-level task, our system provides tools to recognize color blobs and track their location in 3D.  Colors are recognized using CMVision\footnote{CMVision: http://www.cs.cmu.edu/$\sim$jbruce/cmvision/}, and tracked in 3D using depth information from the Xtion sensor\footnote{Lucas Coelho Figueiredo: https://github.com/lucascoelho91/ballFollower}.  This information is used to evaluate environment propositions in the high-level task, discussed in Section~\ref{sec:high-level}.  While we currently only provide object recognition by color, more sophisticated methods could easily be included.

\section{Hardware Abstraction}
\label{sec:configuration-specifics}
%
SMORES-EP has the capability to \emph{self-reconfigure}: changing the connected structure of a cluster of modules to assume different shapes and capabilities.  In order to specify tasks for SMORES-EP (or any other self-reconfigurable robot) at a high level, we must abstract the robot in a way that captures the fact that its capabilities are a function of its configuration (connected structure). For the purposes of this work, we rely on a framework first presented in \cite{Jing2016}, which we summarize here.

In this framework, the entire modular robot system is treated as a single robot with capabilities defined by a design library. A library entry is defined as $l = (C,B_C,P_e,P_b)$ where:
\begin{itemize}
\item $C$ is the robot \emph{configuration}, specified by the connected structure of the modules.
\item $B$ is a \emph{behavior} that $C$ can perform. A behavior is a controller that commands the robot to perform a specific useful action. 
\item $P_b$ is a set of \emph{behavior properties} that describes what $B$ does. 
\item $P_e$ is a set of \emph{environment properties} that describe the environment in which this library entry is suitable. 
\end{itemize} 




In this work, we created five library entries for two different configurations,
listed in Table~\ref{table:1}. 
The ``Tank'' configuration shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:dropoff} is capable of picking
up and dropping objects in ``free'' environment while driving on a flat plain as a
differential drive robot.
The ``Proboscis'' configuration shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:pink_grab} has
a long arm in front, and is suitable for reaching between obstacles in a narrow ``tunnel'' environment to grasp objects.
However, the locomotion ability of this configuration is limited to forward/backward
motion, making it unsuitable for general navigation.

This library-based framework allows us to specify tasks for modular robots at a high level. Environment
properties $P_e$ specify when a given behavior can be used, and are a function of
the sensed environment.  In Section~\ref{sec:environment-characterization}, we discuss
the methods we use to extract environment properties from 3D sensor data. When we
specify tasks at the high level, we use behavior properties $P_b$ to describe an
action we want the robot to take without explicitly specifying which configuration
or behavior to use.

For example, if a task specification requires the robot to execute a $pickUp$ behavior, our system could select  either the Tank or Proboscis configurations to perform the action, since both have behaviors with $P_b=pickUp$. To make the decision, the system will consider the current environment properties, $P_e$, extracted from sensor data.  In the case that $P_e=tunnel$, only the Proboscis configuration can be used, and the robot will take  reconfigure to form the Proboscis if it is not already in that configuration.

Since self-reconfiguration is time-consuming, decisions are biased toward behaviors associated with the current configuration whenever possible, so that the robot only reconfigures when it is necessary to complete a task.

\section{Characterization of Environment Properties}
\label{sec:environment-characterization}
%
As discussed in Section~\ref{sec:configuration-specifics}, the system takes environment properties into account when selecting an appropriate library entry to complete an action. Our perception suite includes functions that process the 3D information to identify environment properties.

%In order to intelligently choose appropriate configurations when performing tasks, the robot must perceive and characterize its environment into a discrete set of environment types that correspond with configuration capabilities. The proposed system includes a perception component that discretely characterizes the environment for the purpose of retrieving an object. This characterization can then be used by the high-level planner to determine the appropriate configuration and gait for successful object retrieval. 

Currently, the perception suite includes functions to recognize three environment properties relevant to object retrieval tasks, shown in Figure \ref{fig:characters}.  When an object is recognized in the environment, the 3D information about its surroundings is evaluated. If the object's position is higher than a threshold height, the environment is characterized as the ``ledge,'' likely requiring a library entry that can reach up to the top of the ledge to retrieve the object.
If the object is on the ground, an occupancy grid is created around it, and all grid cells within a robot-radius of obstacles are denoted unreachable (as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:characterization}). The closest reachable point to the object within $20^o$ of the robot's line of sight to the object is selected. If the distance from this point to the object is greater than a threshold value, the environment is characterized as a ``tunnel,'' likely requiring a configuration that is narrow enough to move between the surrounding obstacles to retrieve the object.
If the environment surrounding the object does not meet the criteria for either a ``ledge'' or ``tunnel,'' it is characterized as ``free.''
%If the environment type is ``tunnel'', the algorithm also selects a navigation waypoint at which the robot can reconfigure before retrieving the object. This waypoint is calculated by extending the closest point farther away from the object to be retrieved (red arrow in Figure \ref{fig:characterization}). This information is passed to the high-level planner for use in controller synthesis.

\section{Reconfiguration}
\label{sec:reconfiguration}
%
Reconfiguration refers to the process of changing the connective topology of an MSRR system's modules in order to change its morphology.  SMORES-EP is capable of all three classes of modular self-reconfiguration (chain, lattice, and mobile reconfiguration) \cite{Davey2012}.  For the purposes of this work, we have developed tools for mobile reconfiguration with SMORES-EP, taking advantage of the modules' ability to drive on flat surfaces as described in section \ref{sec:hardware}.

Determining the relative position of modules during mobile self-reconfiguration is an important challenge. As discussed in Section~\ref{sec:related-work}, past systems have relied on offboard global positioning systems \cite{Paulos2015} or distributed approaches, in which sensors are mounted on each disconnected set of modules \cite{Yim2007}.  Our localization method is centralized, using an RGB camera carried by the robot to track AprilTag fiducials mounted to individual modules.  The camera is mounted to the sensor module at a height of 20cm above the xtion RGB-D camera, and faces downward at \(40^\circ\) to vertical, providing accurate tracking in a \(1m\) by \(1.5m\) rectangular area on the ground in front of the sensor module.  Within this area (which we call the \emph{reconfiguration zone}), any module equipped with an AprilTag marker can detach from the cluster, drive to another location, and reattach to the cluster, provided that both of its wheels were in contact with the ground in its starting position.% \TODO{Get accurate number for height and FoV.}

\subsection{Reconfiguration Procedure}
Given an initial configuration and a goal configuration, our reconfiguration controller commands a set of modules to disconnect, move and reconnect in order to form the new topology of the goal configuration. The process consists of three stages: i) Pre-reconfiguration, ii) Module Movement, iii) Post-reconfiguration.

\paragraph{Pre-reconfiguration} In the pre-reconfiguration stage, the robot takes actions to establish the conditions needed for reconfiguration.  It begins by confirming that the reconfiguration zone is a flat surface free of obstacles (other than the modules themselves).  If the robot is carrying an object, it drops the object outside of the reconfiguration zone. It then  sets its joint angles so that all modules that need to detach have both of their wheels on the ground, ready to drive. Once these conditions are established, module movement begins.

\paragraph{Module Movement} During this stage, the topology of the cluster changes as a sequence of module movement operations are performed.  Each operation involves detaching one module from the cluster, driving, and re-attaching at its new location in the goal configuration.

We denote a module movement operation as $MP=\left(m, m_d, m_a, f_m^d, f_m^a, f_{m_d}, f_{m_a}, \sigma \right)$ where:
\begin{itemize}
\item $m$ is the module whose location will be changed in this module operation.
\item $m_d$ is the module that connects with $m$ before the operation.
\item $m_a$ is the module that connects with $m$ after the operation. Notice $m_d$ and $m_a$ can be the same module. 
\item The face $f_m^d$ of module $m$ connects with the face $f_{m_d}$ of module $m_d$ before the operation.
\item The face $f_m^a$ of module $m$ connects with the face $f_{m_a}$ of module $m_a$ after the operation. Notice $f_m^d$ and $f_m^a$ can be the same face. In this work, we assume $f_m^a$ can only be the front or the back face of the module $m$.
\item $\sigma$ is the path that module $m$ will follow during the operation.
\end{itemize}

Fig.~\ref{fig:reconf} demonstrates an example of a single module operation.
As shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:reconf}a, module $m$ detaches from module $m_d$.
In this process, magnets on $f_m^d$ and $f_{m_d}$ are turned off to eliminate the bond between two faces.
Then module $m$ moves the tilt joint while rotating the left and right wheel forwards to break the connection with $m_d$ and drives away from it.
After $m$ detaches from $m_d$, the controller drives $m$ as a two-wheel differential drive robot to follow the path $\sigma$ with localization provided with the sensor module using AprilTags
%(\TODO{cite})
system. This process is illustrated by Fig.~\ref{fig:reconf}b.
The path $\sigma$ is collision free with the rest of the robot and computed \textit{a priori}. 
Once $m$ reaches the end of $\sigma$, it adjusts its heading by spinning in place till face $f_m^a$ aligning with $f_{m_a}$.
The magnets on face $f_m^a$ and $f_{m_a}$ are turned on to help create connection later between two faces.
As demonstrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:reconf}c, as last $m$ drives towards $m_a$ while perform minor adjustment in the tilt joint till two modules are fully connected.

    \end{subfigure}
    \caption{An example of a module operation for reconfiguration.}
      \label{fig:reconf}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Post-reconfiguration} Once all module movement operations have completed and the goal topology is formed, the robot sets its joints to appropriate angles for the goal configuration to begin performing desired behaviors, and if necessary, the robot picks up any objects it dropped. This completes the reconfiguration process.

To bring together the actuation, sensing, and reconfiguration capabilities of  the  robot as a complete system for accomplishing  tasks, we employ an existing framework LTLMoP to automatically generate robot controllers from user-specified high-level instructions using formal methods \cite{DBLP:conf/iros/FinucaneJK10,DBLP:journals/trob/Kress-GazitFP09}.
LTLMoP allows us to use each component of our system as a low-level atomic controller and specify a wide-range of reactive robotic tasks as a set of high-level instructions using these controllers.
In this section, we will mainly discuss how we model our system in order to use LTLMoP to automatically generate a high-level controller for our desired robot task.

\subsection{Controller Synthesis}
We first abstract the system and environment as a set of Boolean propositions.
For example, the system proposition ``pickUp'' is \lt if the robot is currently picking up an object (and \lf otherwise), and
the environment proposition ``object'' is \lt if the robot is currently sensing an object of interest (and \lf otherwise).

LTLMoP supports a high-level language called Structured English that allows the robot task to be specified in terms of these propositions.
For example, Specification~\ref{spec:experiment} shows the high-level instructions from the user that direct the robot to explore a room, search and move any object of interest to a drop-off zone.
In addition to ``pickUp'', this specification uses the system propositions ``explore'', ``drop'', ``carry'', ``driveToDropoff'' and ``driveToObject,'' each of which represents a different robot action.
Moreover, environment proposition ``arrived'' is \lt if the robot arrives at its target location, and ``dropoffzone'' is \lt if the robot is currently sensing a drop-off zone.

\vspace{-0.4cm}
\end{spec}

Given a specification,  LTLMoP will synthesize a robot controller that satisfies the given robot task (if one exists). The controller synthesized is in the form of a finite state automaton. Each state is labeled with the values of all system propositions. Each transition between two states is labeled with the value of all environment propositions.

\subsection{Controller Execution}
Since the synthesized high-level controller is a discrete finite state automaton, we need to implement it continuously in order to control the robot to satisfy the given task. 

Each environment proposition is mapped to a low-level sensing program that gathers and processes the information from sensors in order to characterize the environment state. For example, the propositions ``object'' is mapped to a sensing program offered by exploration component in Section~\ref{sec:exploration} that returns \lt or \lf based on whether the robot can detect a predefined pink or green object with its camera.

Similarly, each system proposition is mapped to behavior properties that specify how the action should be performed. As explained in Section~\ref{sec:configuration-specifics}, behavior and environment properties determine which library entry should be used to implement a given action.
For example, to implement the ``pickUp'' proposition in Specification~\ref{spec:experiment}, the system can execute any behavior that has the $Pick up$  behavior property, and which also satisfies the current environment properties.  If the current robot configuration cannot execute an appropriate behavior, the robot will reconfigure to a different configuration that can.   

%Each system proposition is mapped to a low-level control program that commands the robot to perform some behaviors. For example, the proposition ``pickUp'' is mapped to a program that will be executed when ``pickUp'' is \ltnsp. The program command the robot to perform a predefined behavior that will pick up a small magnetic object in front of the robot.
% In each iteration, first we determine the value of each environment propositions by calling each corresponding sensing program.
% We then can find the next state in the finite state automaton by taking the transition that matches with the current values of all environment propositions.
% At last, we execute the corresponding control program based on the value of each system proposition specified in the next state and continue to the next iteration.

Execution of the high-level controller begins at the predefined initial state in the finite state automaton. In each iteration, the values of all environment propositions and and environment properties are determined by calling the corresponding sensing program. Then, we determine the next state in the finite state machine by taking the transition that matches the current value of all environment propositions.
The system then maps the system proposition specified in the next state to its set of behavior properties, and selects a behavior from the design library which satisfies both the behavior properties and current environment properties. If the robot is not currently in a configuration capable of executing the selected behavior, the system commands the robot to reconfigure. Finally, the behavior is executed, and program execution continues on to the next iteration. 

%For example, in Fig.~\ref{fig:automaton} we start in the top state and execute the ``explore'' program.
%If  the robot senses a pink object, the value of ``pinkObject'' is \lt and therefore the next state is the bottom right state. We then stop the ``explore'' program and execute the ``driveToObject'' program.

\section{Experiment Results}
\label{sec:experiments}
%

To validate and demonstrate the capabilities of our system, an experiment was run in which a robot composed of SMORES-EP modules completed a complex, high-level task in an unknown environment. Figure \ref{fig:map} shows the environment layout, designed to represent a cluttered office. The high-level task consisted of five sub-tasks of three different types: explore the environment, find and retrieve two objects in the office, and deliver each to a drop-off zone. One object was in the open (a ``free'' environment type), and the other was positioned between two obstacles (a ``tunnel'' environment). Obstacles, environment types, and locations of the objects and drop-off zone were unknown to the robot \textit{a priori}.

Five SMORES-EP modules, one Sensor Module, and three dummy modules were used to compose the robot for performing the task. Steel objects were attached to and carried using the electro-permanent magnets of the SMORES-EP modules.
The two configurations and five behaviors described in Section \ref{sec:configuration-specifics} were available for selection by the high-level planner for this experiment.

Figure \ref{fig:demo} shows snapshots from the experiment run. A video of the entire experiment is available as an attachment to this paper. The starting location prevented the robot from seeing the objects initially, forcing it to explore the environment to search for them. After a period of exploration the robot discovered the pink object first. The characterization algorithm correctly classified the surrounding environment as a ``tunnel'' type, and accordingly the robot navigated in front of the object and reconfigured to the ``proboscis'' configuration. Once this was done, the object was retrieved and pulled out into the open. The robot then dropped the object, reconfigured back to the ``car'' configuration for navigation to the drop-off zone, and again retrieved the object. The robot then navigated to and dropped off the object at the drop-off zone, which was seen during exploration and recorded in the global map built by the SLAM algorithm. Once done, the robot navigated to the green object which was correctly determined to not require any reconfiguration. No further exploration was required since the green object was discovered while the robot was dropping off the pink object. The robot finished the experiment by also delivering the green object to the drop-off zone. Figure \ref{fig:octomap} shows the final volumetric map of the environment explored by the robot as it explored the environment and delivered objects. The robot successfully completed all tasks in the experiment in about 26 minutes. Note that the video shows a human reaching into the field to touch the green object once the robot comes into contact with it. This was due to a error on the field resulting in the object becoming stuck between two floor boards, so a human dislodged it so the robot could grasp it normally.

\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:discussion}
%
\subsection{Challenges}
The experiment demonstrated that our system can autonomously perform complex high-level tasks in an unknown environment. It also revealed many issues that make autonomous reactive tasks difficult to achieve in modular systems. This section discusses issues that were observed and solutions that were implemented to overcome them.

Due to limitations of individual modules, robot speed was very low. In addition, having a robotic system composed of 6 individual robotic components (5 SMORES-EP modules and 1 sensor module) multiplies the chance of a component having a hardware failure. The long runtime combined with multiplied failure points resulted in a high risk of an error occurring during the experiment. Thus, each system component had to be designed with features to make it as robust as possible, and several error recovery features had to be implemented in the system.

The processing power required for perception and environment characterization presented issues with size and computation speed. As can be seen from Figure~\ref{fig:sensor-module}, the sensor module is significantly larger than a regular module in order to hold the required sensors and computer board. This imposes significant limitations on possible configurations and their locomotion abilities, due to the low connection strength and power of modules. At the same time, the small computer board used in the sensor module results in low computation power, which causes the sensor processing and perception algorithms to run slowly and have less accuracy. Simple configuration designs and efficient algorithms were used to address these issues. Future autonomous modular systems would benefit significantly from powerful but highly compact, lightweight sensing and processing components that can be carried onboard the robot while imposing minimal size and weight constraints.

As with many autonomous systems, uncertainties such as sensor noise and controller lag create issues with robust behavior. For example, the global map and robot pose determined by visual SLAM accumulate significant errors (due to sensor noise) as time progresses. To compensate, repetitive feedback controllers and checks were implemented during task performance. As the robot navigates toward and retrieves objects, it constantly updates its estimate of the object location as new measurements of the object are received. During reconfiguration, docking modules are checked and re-aligned several times during the docking process to ensure they are lined up precisely before connecting to each other. This helps the robot recover from controller lag or noisy AprilTag measurements.

Finally, some simple hardware failures were encountered during experiment runs. Since SMORES-EP modules are research prototypes built from scratch, they are more prone to failures such as microcontroller errors and position control errors from custom encoders. Future experiments can be improved in robustness by improving the hardware quality of modules to bring them closer to the level of a commercial product.
%
\subsection{Reconfiguration}
Our method of reconfiguration has advantages compared to existing methods.  Use of an onboard overhead camera to provide fiducial-based localization for reconfiguration is novel.  This centralized strategy provides localization only near the sensor module, so the number of modules that can reconfigure at once is limited by the size of the camera view. In order to scale to large numbers of modules, multiple sensor modules would need to be used in parallel.

By exploiting high-fidelity centralized localization and the individual mobility of the SMORES-EP modules, we achieve reconfiguration that is rapid, robust, and cleanly deployable in the context of a high-level task.  In our experiments (Section~\ref{sec:experiments}), we observed that the pre-reconfiguration state required about 20 seconds, each module movement operation required about 45 seconds, and post-reconfiguration required about 10 seconds.
%Each reconfiguration action had a success rate over 90\%.
This compares very favorably with existing methods, in which each reconfiguration action can take on the order of ten minutes \cite{Yim2007},\cite{Murata2006},\cite{Rubenstein2004}.

\subsection{Future Work and Conclusion}
%
We presented a novel system for autonomously accomplishing high-level tasks in unknown environments with modular self-reconfigurable robots.  This system is the first to use perception of an unknown environment to reactively perform complex high-level tasks using intelligent reconfiguration. Components of this system include novel controller synthesis, environment characterization, and self-reconfiguration methods. The system was validated using a physical experiment using a high-level task consisting of a heterogenous set of 5 sub-tasks in an \textit{a priori} unknown environment. 

The system is not without limitations, and could be significantly extended in future work.  First and foremost, the experiment we present utilizes only two configurations, and our perception system demonstrates the ability to recognize only two special environments (ledge and tunnel).  MSRR systems are supposed to provide wide flexibility at addressing tasks. To truly prove this promise, we need to demonstrate that MSRR systems can reconfigure between a much wider variety of morphologies, in response to a large number of environments.  We believe that our system could be extended to such scenarios, but we do not minimize the difficulty of the problems one should expect to encounter in tackling these problems. 

While the presented system successfully demonstrated that modular robots can autonomously achieve a realistic object retrieval task, limitations of the modular hardware make them unsuitable for application in harsh real-world scenarios such as search-and-rescue.  One of the biggest limitations is simply the small size and small forces that can be applied by the modules.  Given current actuator and connector technology, it is still very difficult to apply large enough forces to operate in a realistic search-and-rescue environment. 

It is important to consider how the presented system could be adapted to work with other modular robot hardware.  Certain aspects of the system are almost entirely hardware-independent, such as the sensing and navigation tools, the high-level planner, and the hardware abstractions.  The reconfiguration method is in some ways specific to SMORES-EP, because it relies on the ability of each module to move by differential drive on the flat plane.  The majority of MSRR hardware systems do not have this capability, and would not be able to reconfigure in this way.  However, we believe the success of this novel reconfiguration method could have some implications for MSRR hardware design: future designers might want to consider designing for individual mobility and forgiving connectors, in order to take advantage of a reconfiguration method similar to the one present.

To conclude, this paper presents the first system that enables modular self-reconfigurable robots to autonomously achieve tasks requiring perception-informed reconfiguration in an unknown environment.  This capability is crucial to the success of modular robots as a technology, and by demonstrating it for the first time, we believe we have taken a real step toward the application of modular robots to solve tasks in the real world.
